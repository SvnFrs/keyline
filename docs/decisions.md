# Decisions

Append-only. To change a decision, add a new entry that supersedes the old one.

| ID | Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | 2026-09-24 | Name: **keyline** | Free on npm and PyPI (checked 2026-09-24). No slide or design tool with that name found. Every "Slide Bench" spelling is taken. |
| D-002 | 2026-09-24 | License: Apache-2.0. `NOTICE`: "Copyright 2026 Tyler (@SvnFrs)" | Same license as impeccable and OfficeCLI; public repo |
| D-003 | 2026-09-24 | Output: editable `.pptx`. OfficeCLI builds decks and renders previews | Users want native, editable decks and corporate templates, and HTML-to-pptx conversion loses fidelity (research §1, §4) |
| D-004 | 2026-09-24 | `keyline lint` reads the OOXML package with lxml, with no OfficeCLI dependency. Supersedes the prototype's `dump` approach | Lints decks from any source, runs in the claude.ai sandbox, avoids L-001 |
| D-005 | 2026-09-24 | The gate is a tool (`keyline check`), not a hook | claude.ai web and desktop have no hooks (support docs, 2026-09) |
| D-006 | 2026-09-24 | Distribution: one Agent Skill folder, zipped for claude.ai web and desktop, installed or synced for Claude Code. Package code is vendored into the skill (M2) | Skills upload as a ZIP and sync one-way to Claude Code; no programmatic upload exists (anthropics/claude-code#93163) |
| D-007 | 2026-09-24 | Finding contract modeled on impeccable: JSON on stdout, human output on stderr, exit 0 / 2 / 1; `advisory` findings never fail | Proven in CI and hooks; one contract for every consumer |
| D-008 | 2026-09-24 | Two modes: `presented` (default) and `read` | The canon conflicts on density because presented decks and reading decks are different artifacts |
| D-009 | 2026-09-24 | Build order: lint core (M1), then skill + brief + first pack (M2), then fonts + hooks (M3) | The author needs usable decks early; the report's order optimized only for a moat |
| D-010 | 2026-09-24 | Benchmark name deferred. Avoid SlidesBench and SlideBench variants | Both names are taken (AutoPresent, slidebench.org, SlideChat) |
| D-011 | 2026-09-24 | Roles: Tyler decides, Claude Code executes, an external Claude session audits by cloning | Independent verification: the builder does not grade its own work |

- **D-012 · Python >= 3.11.** Use stdlib `tomllib`, with no custom TOML reader.
  - CI runs Python 3.11 and 3.13.
  - This supersedes the ">= 3.10" in CLAUDE.md and spec §1.
  - Why: 3.10 reaches end of life in October 2026 (PEP 619). The auditor's Claude
    sandbox runs 3.11.15. A 60-line parser that exists only to support a version
    dying next month is risk with no return.
- **D-013 · Commit trailers.** `Co-Authored-By: Claude … <noreply@anthropic.com>`
  trailers are allowed. The identity rule covers personal names and personal emails,
  not tool attribution. The AC-12 allowlist includes these trailers.
- **D-014 · Commit identity (decided by Tyler, 2026-09-24).**
  - Author and committer name: `Tyler` or `SvnFrs`.
  - Email: `thaidvq.work@gmail.com`.
  - Existing commits `ce21744` and `705edc1` stay as they are. There is no history
    rewrite and no repo recreation.
  - Why: Tyler accepts that the GitHub handle and this email are public. Given that, a
    rewrite would cost effort and achieve nothing, because GitHub keeps rewritten
    commits reachable by SHA anyway.
  - AC-12 allowlist:
    - the names and email above;
    - Claude co-author trailers (D-013);
    - GitHub's web-UI committer, `GitHub <noreply@github.com>`, so that merging from
      the web UI does not fail the test.
